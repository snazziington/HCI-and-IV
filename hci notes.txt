Things I Need to do Next:
---
UI
1. Each star needs a short description in the pop-up window.
2. There should be a close button when the constellation window appears (top right ofc)
	a. If the user left clicks off the pop-up window, that should also close it
	b. The user should not be able to draw while the popup window is there.
	c. Maybe they also cannot pan when the popup window is there.
3. You should be able to click on the star in the library to get the pop-up window to appear
4. You should be able to click on the finished constellation in the canvas to get a pop-up window to appear
	a. Or maybe as you're hovering a finished constellation it showed a checkmark next to your mouse? So you know it is finished?
	b. Or if you click a finished constellation there's a pop up that says "This is [constellation name]. Click here for more details." And if you click on that window, /then/ the pop-up window appears
5. When you finish drawing a constellation, a little temporary window should pop up saying "You just finished drawing [constellation name]! Click here for more info."
6. There should be an image of the constellation next to the name in the library.
7. Change background colour of both windows to darkish purple (semi-transparent).
8. Choose a nice font for the constellation names, and increase the font size of the name.
9.

Priorities
1. Should add the ball ache that is going to be "stars with left over connections should glow."
	a. If a stars has no connections. Then the star should only glow if it is a neighbouring star.
	b. If a star has at least ONE connections, but not all of them. Then the star should keep glowing until all its connections are made.
---
Feedback:
1. Add a visual cue when the constellation is finished (particles/confetti/don't be overdramatic about it) (confetti)
Priorities:
2. If you are hovering a completed constellation, it should play a different sound to the "nothing is here" sound and text should pop up saying "You have finished drawing this constellation (Pisces).
---
5. If a neighbouringStar is off screen it show glow much larger.
---
Optimisations:
1. Optimise the code
	a. In bigStars and Stars draw(), if the star is not visible, don't draw it
	b. Could reduce number of stars and bigStars to like 100 each. And when you scroll right and it is no longer visible, add windowWidth/windowHeight to it (so the star teleports to the edge of the window so it is technically "always" there.
---
Extensions:
1. Telegraph which stars still need to be connected
2. Save and reset feature?
3. Sound slider (in settings?)
---
Done To-Dos:
1. Drag w/ middle mouse button ✓✓
2. Add all drawn stars to the startingStars array. ✓✓
3. It's make more sense if constellations are on screen when you start. ✓✓
4. Ensure startingStars do not grow larger when at least one line has been drawn in the constellation. ✓✓
5. Ensure that neighbouring stars also grow when the constellation is selected. ✓✓
6. Should honestly clean up the code and add more headings + regions. I should allocate 30 mins to this. I could technically watch smt while doing this bcs it is quite a low-effort task. ✓✓
7. Sometimes overlay constellations disappears behind the actuar star. Ensure minimum size is bigger. ✓✓
8. Add auditory cues
	a. startDrawing
	b. cannotStartHere
	c. continuedToNextStar
	d. stoppedDrawing
	e. completedConstellation
9. Need to figure out why no sound is playing when I press nothing.

constructor() {
		this.x = random(width);
		this.y = random(height);
		this.size = random(1, 2.49);
		this.t = random(TAU);
	}

	draw() {
		this.t += 0.03;
		var scale = this.size + sin(this.t) / 4;
		let opacity = this.size * 12;
		noStroke();

		// Highlight
		fill(200, 195, 255, opacity);
		ellipse(this.x, this.y, scale * 3, scale * 3);

		// Star
		fill(200, 195, 255, opacity * 10);
		ellipse(this.x, this.y, scale, scale);
---
Maybe when a star is within starting star, it should turn green (so I can easily see which are in starting stars).
Then, every x seconds they pulsate.
I should also ensure that the constellation stars twinkle randomly.
---
When I make a constellation, I want its stars to be objects from the constellationStars class.
So when I create a constellation, e.g., Aries
Each star is creates as a constellationStar. But each star also needs its own name.

so if I want the name of each constellation to be in the same spot putting them in constellations[x][0]) then i'd have to add 1 to all the indexes of the stars. because they would no longer start at 0, but at 1.
---
currentStar should be equal to the star you're hovering over IF it is a starting star
---
if you are not drawing. and the mouse is near a startstar. then you should be able to draw from there.
---
Need to ensure that pairs are only pushed to starting stars IF they are not in it already.
---
Need to figure out how I get the value of the star that I am hovering over.
---
For reasons beyond my current comprehension, the drawing fucks up when the user presses CENTER to stop drawing. the neighbouring stars do NOT change. They SHOULD.
---
Add a condition to 
---
If you right click and the drawing is not yet complete, add the most recent stars into the starting stars function.
Actually, it should add any stars that still have neighbour stars that have yet to be drawn to the starting stars function. And I think they should be glowing too. For now maybe I can make them orange or something? aaaaaa
---
1. Size up the canvas
2. Work on panning function 
---
Maybe I should push bigDipper into an array called "completed constellations".
---
Maybe if a constellation has not been finished, it disappears? Would be annoying if it's a big one though.
Alternative is that the constellation stays half finished (better) and the user can return later. Also better for constellations that have multiple connected parts
I do have to write code where the starting stars are also equal to the last drawn stars IF they have unfinished neighbouring stars. AAAAAAA
---
I think for knowing whether the constellation is complete, I would have to check for each constellation (in the switch case) whether the user has clicked between the two specific points. And I can have it be like "bigDipperLine" [0] = 0 by default, and when you have clicked between the two points is becomes 1. Which means you have made one connection. And when all of bigDipperLine = 1 (check via for loop, then the constellation turns pink. So that I know.

When you click on a new point and successfully draw a line. The point you are drawing from should become "prevVertex." The new point should become "currentVertex" (we have current star, maybe use that?

---
make object for constellation
make instances of the object with different coordinates per constellation, shapes etc, connecting stars
---
Add "pausingInput" variable to code. When yPressed is played, pausing inPut = 1. when Input starts again, write 222 and set pausingInput to 0.
Add "pausingInput ==0" as a condition for the lights to go on
