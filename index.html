        <p>Aquarius is the eleventh sign of the zodiac and is considered as governing the period from about January 20th
          to about February 18th. It is represented as a man pouring a stream of water out of a jug, likely because in
          ancient times the rising of Aquarius coincided in the Middle East with a period of floods and rain.</p>

        <p><b>Astrology</b></p>
        <p>Pisces is the 12th sign of the zodiac, and is considered as governing the period from about February 19th to
          about
          March 20th. Its representation as two fish tied together is usually related to the Greek myth of Aphrodite and
          Eros, who jumped into a river to escape the monster Typhon and changed into fish, or alternatively, the two
          fish that carried them to safety.</p>
